# Event KeyCodes (Press and Watch the Magic)

## Overview
This project is designed to help users identify which key was pressed on the keyboard, along with its associated `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` values. It dynamically updates the webpage to show this information in a table format when any key is pressed.

## How It Works
- When the user presses a key on the keyboard, a table is generated showing the `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` for the pressed key.
- The table updates in real-time as different keys are pressed.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Press any key on your keyboard to see its associated `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` values.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Notes on Key Events

### `key`
The `key` property returns the value of the key pressed. For example:
- If you press the `A` key, `e.key` will be `"a"` or `"A"` depending on whether Shift is pressed.
- If you press the spacebar, `e.key` will be `" "` (a space character).
  
**Example:**
```javascript
e.key // Returns the character of the key pressed (e.g., "a" or "A")
```

### `keyCode`
The `keyCode` property returns the numeric code of the key pressed. This property is deprecated but still commonly used for identifying certain keys.

- **Examples:**
  - The keycode for `Enter` is `13`.
  - The keycode for `Space` is `32`.
  
**Example:**
```javascript
e.keyCode // Returns the numeric code for the key pressed (e.g., 32 for space)
```

### `code`
The `code` property returns a string representing the physical key on the keyboard that was pressed. It doesn’t change based on whether Shift or Caps Lock is active. The value returned by `code` depends on the physical location of the key.

- **Examples:**
  - If you press the `KeyA`, the `code` will be `"KeyA"`.
  - The `code` for the `Space` key is `"Space"`.
  
**Example:**
```javascript
e.code // Returns the physical key on the keyboard (e.g., "KeyA", "Space")
```
